  Added makfname.
20/02/2018, 00.01.11 - makprep fixed to save electrode id to channel and
  probe mappings. Added makspk.
21/02/2018, 00.01.12 - makload has '-groupspikes' option flag that saves
  makspk output to d.spike , replacing original content.
01/03/2018, 00.01.13 - makrpcorr and makrccg added. The latter is untested.
06/03/2018, 00.01.14 - maksttc added. Largly untested.
09/03/2018, 00.01.15 - maksttc_cutts added. maksttc partially validated.
14/03/2018, 00.01.16 - Corrected indexing error inside makrccg ; adapts
  how P and X are computed based on output requests , will use low-memory
  method if they are not.  maksttc handles case of no spikes in window in
  getspks , and does not overrun A or B in while loops for leading spikes;
  now returns or accepts Tab, Fi, and N arguments for pre-computation and
  reducing overall memory use ; overhaul of STTC computation to further
  reduce memory burden.
01/04/2018, 00.01.17 - Changes to makprep. Introduced parameters
  .elect.keep and .spksort.skip to control whether electrode rejection or
  automated spike sorting are performed. Instead of throwing an error,
  trials will be rejected if the analysis epoch is not present.
  hitcompatible now deals with the empty matrices that are returned when
  one stimulus dynamically changes hit regions during a trial and the rest
  do not.
04/04/2018, 00.01.18 - Added makrastplot for visualising spike rasters.
06/04/2018, 00.01.19 - Added makgabor. Fixed problem in makprep where
  n2pclim not set during alignment by MET signals.
11/04/2018, 00.01.20 - makwavg added to compute weighted averages. makddi
  added to compute disparity discrimination index.
16/04/2018, 00.01.21 - Fixed makddi to check that the number of trials
  exceeds the number of disparity levels, and ignores NaN values. Fixed
  makwavg, which calculated weighted average the wrong way. makmedstd
  computes median and standard deviation around the median.
22/04/2018, 00.01.22 - Added makroc that computes ROC curves and associated
  statistics for a set of spike clusters or a set of time bins.
23/04/2018, 00.01.23 - Fixed error with makroc when handling repeat values.
  makroc now handles N-dimensional data sets. makbalancedz added to convert
  data into balanced z-scores.
24/04/2018, 00.01.24 - Fixed minor conceptual errors in makbalancedz and
  debugged multidimensional data handling.
25/04/2018, 00.01.25 - makrccg can now return shift-corrected cross-
  correlations.
26/04/2018, 00.01.26 - maknsp2ptb now handles the case when the Cerebus
  saves more than one mstart/mstop signal to its digin records.
  makreclasstrial no longer launches an error when an end state is not
  found, it simply rejects the trial.
04/05/2018, 00.01.27 - maksave handles d( i ).header struct array with more
  than one element. makreactime uses alternative estimate of velocity and
  acceleration thresholds if the lognormal ones are crazy.
07/05/2018, 00.01.28 - makprep now checks that Cerebus files actually exist
  before opening them. makreactime no longer looks for the end of the
  saccade past the end of eye.time.
09/05/2018, 00.01.29 - makrccg now returns the cross-correlogram that is
  normalised by a triangular function and the geometric mean firing rate
  of the neurone pair (see Bair et al 2001 , Methods , Equation 6).
11/05/2018, 00.01.30 - makimat added , it returns logical index matrix for
  accessing specific spike cluster pairs.
16/05/2018, 00.01.31 - makreclasstrial uses incorrect column indeces to
  access eye position data saved by MET.
21/05/2018, 00.01.32 - makcell2mat added to enable concatenation of nested
  cell arrays. makfun now uses makcell2mat to allow functions to return
  cell arrays. makpak added to return specific output arguments of a
  function in a single cell array.
23/05/2018, 00.01.33 - makmi added to compute empirical mutual information.
05/06/2018, 00.01.34 - makprep reaction parameters .lognvel and .lognacc
  can now be set to -1 to force the use of fixed default parameters. New
  makprep parameter .rt.verifythr added to control verification of measured
  velocity and acceleration thresholds. makreactime will now use the
  .rt.stim parameter to refine which eye samples are used to measure
  velocity and acceleration thresholds ; that is , it will try to ignore
  samples that have left the fixation target when estimating velocity and
  acceleration thresholds. makreactime properly sets irefstim when no
  fixation target is available.
11/06/2018, 00.01.35 - Adds makskiptime for calculating start time, end
  time, and duration of skipped frames.
13/06/2018, 00.01.36 - makbalancedz now replaces balanced standard devs
  equal to zero with values of 1. This happens for columns of x that are
  all zeros. The remedy allows the return of a column of zeros as balanced
  z-scores.
22/07/2018, 00.01.37 - makcrosstalk added to measure shared signal between
  pairs of electrodes. High proportions of synchronous spikes with similar
  waveform shapes will be detected if there is, for instance, a flaw with
  the probe or software.
26/07/2018, 00.01.38 - Indexing error in makrccg where lower-triangular
  part of rccg below the diagonal is not properly transposed to the upper-
  triangular part above the diagonal.
29/08/2018, 00.01.39 - makrccg no longer returns 1's for the r_ccg auto-
  correlations. Rather, the shift-corrected auto-correlation is returned at
  each integration lag. This way, the cross-correlated r_ccg values can be
  turned back into something analogous to the covariance with units of
  spikes-per-millisecond squared. This is useful for computing the bias-
  corrected linear Fisher information at different integration lags. Added
  maklinfin, which implements the bias-corrected linear Fisher information
  equations from Kanitscheider et al. (2015), essentially wrapping their
  BCFisher, BCFisherCross, BCFisherDiag, and BCFisherShuf into a single
  function. Unlike their functions, maklinfin expects the tuning curves and
  covariance matrices to be computed and then handed in. This adds much
  more flexibility when handling large and complex data sets, or analyses.
30/08/2018, 00.01.40 - maklinfin tweaked to require shuffled covariance
  matrix for 'diag' sub-function, this returns results with an identical
  distribution to Kanitscheider et al.'s BCFisherDiag function.
31/10/2018, 00.01.41 - makroc had an indexing error when calculating
  Youden's J statistic for special cases where that statistic defaults to
  -Inf.
20/11/2018, 00.01.42 - makmergetool updated to zero pad missing rows in
  PCA array, guarantees that three-dimensional plots won't crash.
22/11/2018, 00.01.43 - makbindvar added to return the mean and error of one
  variable that is binned according to the values of another variable.
25/11/2018, 00.01.44 - makmi tweaked for about 15% reduction in run time.
30/01/2019, 00.01.45 - makevtim added to return event times on each trial.
19/03/2019, 00.01.46 - makpspkern added for PSP-shaped convolution kernel.
12/04/2019, 00.01.47 - Ugly hack fixes to makprep.m and maknsp2ptb.m to
  get around problems of using Serial I/O start and stop recording signals
  between MET and the Cerebus. makprep ignores Serial I/O and maknsp2ptb
  requires new parameters .useheader and .relaxedmatch.
01/07/2019, 00.01.48 - Added makkeepspk.m to reject spikes thought to
  result from cross-talk between electrodes.
30/08/2019, 00.01.49 - Added makxcorr to compute simple cross-correlations
  with potentially better run times than Matlab's xcorr.
04/09/2019, 00.01.50 - Added makconv for FFT based convolution of a set of
  signals.
04/09/2019, 00.01.51 - Added makgaborfit to find best fitting Gabors for a
  set of tuning curves.
05/09/2019, 00.01.52 - Added makaxeq for setting axes square, tight, and
  matching axis limits.
01/10/2019, 00.01.53 - makgaborfit can now fit correlated and anti-
  correlated disparity tuning curves in the same optimisation, returning
  separate amp and phase parameters for each.
13/01/2020, 00.01.54 - Added makrepair with sub-functions fork, nspcheck,
  and nspincr. makreclasstrial returns minlatflg to say whether the break
  has reached some minimum latency following onset of a reference state.
  makprep param broken.minlatency reduced to 0.15. Added param broken.
  minlatkeep to enable retention of broken trials that satisfy latency
  criterion. Added makcf, short form of cellfun(...,'UniformOutput',false).
  Upgraded makcrosstalk so that it can compute crosstalk measures between
  all spike clusters or between electrodes (ignoring rejected spike
  clusters).
14/01/2020, 00.01.55 - Added maktiedrank to compute tied rank for each
  column of an input matrix, unlike tiedrank which only accepts vectors as
  input.
09/04/2020, 00.01.56 - A rare but possible event is that a frame skip
  occurs on the final frame of a trial. This results in a missmatch in the
  number of frames recorded by PTB and the number of frames detected by the
  photodiode. maknsp2ptb.m is adjusted (from line 431 of v00.01.55) so that
  the number of frames is the minimum of the two records. Adds new
  parameter to makprep, p.spksort.noise_thr_auv to discard high-amplitude
  noise spikes prior to spike sorting. It then checks the waveforms after
  aligning to peaks for any spline interpolations that blew up, using the
  same threshold, and zeros any of them.
21/04/2020, 00.01.57 - Added makrfgauss for user-guided least-squares
  Guassian fitting to RF mapping data.
05/05/2020, 00.01.58 - Added makprep parameter par.rt.halfmax, logical flag
  that tells makreactime to search for the maximum velocity and
  acceleration in the time prior to the final mtarg signal, as indicated by
  par.rt.verifythr. Half the maximum value is used as the threshold.
  par.rt.halfmax is now true by default.
26/05/2020, 00.01.59 - Tweak to makgaborfit adding an optional parameter
  struct as the final argument. This is to allow better customisation of
  the fitting procedure by changing upper and lower bounds of the parameter
  search. For now, this will allow changes to the range of horizontal
  offsets, Gaussian widths and amplitudes, and the range of cosinusoidal
  frequencies; the framework allows further additions later. Better check
  on input args x, Y, and Ya. Returns lower, upper bounds on param search
  as well as starting params.
02/07/2020, 00.01.60 - Added makrccg2, optimised for speed. Get it? Mach 2?
  eh...
08/07/2020, 00.01.61 - Added MAK.DataAnalysisTutorial_v1.0.pages & *.pdf
  documents to help guide users in using MAK for general data analysis.
18/12/2020, 00.01.62 - Added makjennrich.m implementing the Jennrich Test
  for equality between two correlation matrices.
